# Background
"All-or-nothing" is rarely satisfactory for describing the dependency between variables or the connectivity between system components.  A matrix is an intuitive way to display a large amount of imformation where each cell corresponds to a given interaction pair.  Using colors corresponding to a gradient palette to fill the cells rapidly conyes the magnitude and directionality or pairwise interactions.
